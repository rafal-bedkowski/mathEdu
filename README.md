## About Me
Hi,\
My name is Rafal and I'm a 3rd year computer science student and a math tutor.
This platform beside learning the software developer tools and technology(as CS student) is mainly for my math "kids" and for anyone who wants to learn and practice mathematics in action. Platform will become better and better as i learn in process, sooo any suggestion will be helpfull.

Thank's for your time\
RB
